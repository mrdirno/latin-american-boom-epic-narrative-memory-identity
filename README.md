## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write the 'lost letter' Tomás waited 12 years for. Who was it from? What did it say, and why did it never arrive?
- Create a monologue from the perspective of the Widow Almeyda, detailing the town's hidden history as she's witnessed it from behind her bar.
- Script the confrontation between a young Sebastián and Tomás during the political upheavals of their past. What was the 'unsaid thing' that drove them apart?
- Describe a memory from the childhood of Sebastián and Tomás in Santa Irene, focusing on a sensory detail (a smell, a sound) that haunts the present.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Santa Irene and the Atacama, where locations are 'unlocked' by fragments of memory text, visually representing the novel's non-linear narrative.
- Create a 'Memory Engine' generative text tool that takes a core object (e.g., a watch, a train whistle, a rusted sign) and produces layered, contradictory narrative fragments in the style of the Boom.
